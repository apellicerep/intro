This project was born due to my university need to have a customized holiday reporting system for their employers. To meet their needs and provide them with a software that only containd the requested features I built it and designed this software as my thesis. 


Some of the features:

* The software allows the administrator to register and manage the academic courses and the employers.
* The employers can add holiday requests, check requests status, keep track of amount of holiday days spent and holiday days left.
* The supervisor receive notifications when a request is made and can accept/decine the requests to plan so that the department always is manned.

Main Technologies:

* Front-End: React and Material-Ui
* Back-End: Express, MySql and Sequelize.

## * [Course Management system](https://github.com/apellicerep/Full-Stack-App-with-React-and-REST-API)

This is my last project(10th) done during my training as a developer in the Teechdegree Fullstack Javascript.

In this Project I've used React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (the one that I created in previous project). The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

To complete this project, I've used my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

I've used:

* JavaScript and JSX to build out the components.
* React Router to set up your routes.
* The Fetch API  to fetch data from your REST API.
* Allow users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.

## * [REST API](https://github.com/apellicerep/REST_Api)

This is the 9th project done during my training as a developer in the Teechdegree Fullstack Javascript.

In this project, I've created a REST API using Express. The API will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.

I've used my knowledge of REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create:

* API routes
* Data modeling with Sequelize ORM
* Basic Authentication
* Validation
* Data persistence (SQL)
* Postman for testing the REST API.

In a future project, I'll complete a full stack JavaScript application by using React to create a client for this REST API.


## * [SQL Library Manager](https://github.com/apellicerep/SQL-LIBRARY-MANAGER)

This is the 8th project done during my training as a developer in the Teechdegree Fullstack Javascript.

Given HTML designs and an existing SQLite database. I have implemented a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize that includes:

* Pages to list.
* Add, update, and delete books.
* Pagination 
* Search field.

## * [React Gallery App](https://github.com/apellicerep/React-Gallery-App)

	title="test" width="550" height="550" />

This is the 7th project done during my training as a developer in the Teechdegree Fullstack Javascript.

For this project, I used the very popular UI Library React Js to create an image gallery app and using the powerful Create React App tool, I setted up the initial project.

I have done:

* Used JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
* Used React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
* Used the tool Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API and use it to display images in the app.
* Add logic to handle the search input.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## * [Express Portfolio](https://github.com/apellicerep/Express-Js-Portfolio)

<img src="portfolio.png" alt="test"
	title="test" width="550" height="550" />

This is the 7th project done during my training as a developer in the Teechdegree Fullstack Javascript.

In this project, I created a portfolio site to showcase the projects that I've builted. I have used  Node.js and Express to

I create a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I have created.

I've used Pug to complete the provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I used Nodejs and Express to:

* Import the required dependencies
* Link the JSON with the Pug templates
* Set up routes to handle requests
* Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
* Handle errors
* Set up a server to serve the project


## * [Employee Directory](https://github.com/apellicerep/Employee_Directory_JS)

<img src="Employee-Directory-550.png" alt="test"
	title="test" width="550" height="550" />

This is the 6th project done during my training as a developer in the Teechdegree Fullstack Javascript.

For this project, I've coded all the Javascript logic for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

I requested a JSON object from the API using asynchronous programming and parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
