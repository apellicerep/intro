## Introduction:
This is a swocase of my recent projects:

This project was born due to my university need to have a customized holiday reporting system for their employers. To meet their needs and provide them with a software that only containd the requested features I built it and designed this software as my thesis. 


Some of the features:

* The software allows the administrator to register and manage the academic courses and the employers.
* The employers can add holiday requests, check requests status, keep track of amount of holiday days spent and holiday days left.
* The supervisor receive notifications when a request is made and can accept/decine the requests to plan so that the department always is manned.

Main Technologies:

* Front-End: React and Material-Ui
* Back-End: Express, MySql and Sequelize.

## 2. Course Management system

This is my last project(10th) done during my training as a developer in the Teechdegree Fullstack Javascript.

In this Project I've used React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (the one that I created in previous project). The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

To complete this project, I've used my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

I've used:

* JavaScript and JSX to build out the components.
* React Router to set up your routes.
* The Fetch API  to fetch data from your REST API.
* Allow users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.

## REST API

This is the 9th project done during my training as a developer in the Teechdegree Fullstack Javascript.

In this project, I've created a REST API using Express. The API will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.

I've used my knowledge of REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create:

* API routes
* Data modeling with Sequelize ORM
* Basic Authentication
* Validation
* Data persistence (SQL)
* Postman for testing the REST API.

In a future project, I'll complete a full stack JavaScript application by using React to create a client for this REST API.
