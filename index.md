This project was born due to my universities need to have a customized holiday reporting system for their employers. To meet their needs and provide them with a software that only containd the requested features I built it and designed this software as my thesis. 

Some of the features:

* The software allows the administrator to register and manage the academic courses and the employers.
* The employers can add holiday requests, check requests status, keep track of amount of holiday days spent and holiday days left.
* The supervisor receive notifications when a request is made and can accept/decine the requests to plan so that the department always is manned.
